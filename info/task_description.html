<p><i>Numerical strings mixed with text are commonly seen in version numbers and are typically sorted by numerical order instead of plain text order.</i></p>

<p>If you have a group of files named in a fashion similar to this: ["1.jpg", "2.jpg", "10.jpg", "20.jpg"], an ordinary sort will give you ["1.jpg", "10.jpg", "2.jpg", "20.jpg"] when you want to get ["1.jpg", "2.jpg", "10.jpg", "20.jpg"].</p>

<p>In other cases, your filename might have non-digit characters like ["2014-5-17 09:00:00.jpg", "2014-05-18 09:00:00.jpg"], an ordinary sort will give you ["2014-05-18 09:00:00.jpg", "2014-5-17 09:00:00.jpg"], but that order is not considered "natural". You could have a case where the number in your filename may not be integer, eg: ["121.6114,25.0411.jpg", "121.5643,25.034.jpg", "-157.8601,21.3053.jpg"]</p>

<p>For non-digit parts in filenames, an ordinary sort should be applied. For this, you won't need to worry about non-aligned cases like: ["2.a","a.2"] as these cases usually don't produce useful results in either situation.</p>

<p>From the above examples you can see that "-" could be used as a hyphen or negative sign. For this task please consider a "-" as negative sign if <b>and only if</b> it is at the beginning of a string of after a space or comma.</p>
